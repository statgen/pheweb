# Importing summary stats to pheweb

## Cromwell run

Import summary stats using [import.wdl](wdl/import.gwas_pipeline.wdl). Prepare a list of summary stats like in reference configuration file (one summary stat bucket path per line) [import.json](wdl/import.gwas_pipeline.json).

Also, you need to generate a custom json (`pheweb_import.fix_json.custom_json`) with additional information per sumstat (n_cases/n_controls, phenotype name, description). Example how to generate that json from R7 with the help of [create_custom_json.py](scripts/create_custom_json.py):

```sh
gsutil cp gs://finngen-production-library-green/finngen_R7/finngen_R7_analysis_data/finngen_R7_pheno_n.tsv .
python3 create_custom_json.py --phenotype_col phenocode --n_cases_col num_cases --n_controls_col num_controls --out_json R7_custom.json finngen_R7_pheno_n.tsv
```

After successful import run, copy generated file to a single bucket using proper file structure using [copy_cromwell_import_to_bucket_puddle.py](scripts/copy_cromwell_import_to_bucket_puddle.py). Parameters needed are cromwell hash and path to destination bucket:

```sh
copy_cromwell_import_to_bucket_puddle.py cromwell_hash gs://bucket_for_deployment_pickerupper/v8/
```

***You need to have a socks5 proxy open in localhost:5000 to cromwell machine to get the metadata.***

Example proxy creation if cromwell runs in google VM:

```sh
gcloud compute ssh cromwell-machine-name -- -D localhost:5000 -N
```

Alternatively if direct access available change url with `--cromwell_url yourURL` and remove proxy (--socks_proxy "")

## Cromwell run (meta-analysis results)

Use [import.ukbb.wdl](wdl/import.ukbb.wdl).

Use [import.ukbb.json](wdl/import.ukbb.json) as a config template. Most of the variables/files don't need to be changed, but two input files need to be generated:

1. `pheweb_import.summaryfiles`: list of meta-analysis result summary stats (one summary stat bucket path per line)
2. `pheweb_import.fix_json.custom_json`: file providing additional information per phenotype (n_cases/n_controls, phenotype name, description). Required fields are defined in the variable `"pheweb_import.fix_json.fields"`.

You can use scripts [ukbb_json.py](scripts/ukbb_json.py) and [merge_jsons.py](scripts/merge_jsons.py), or [create_custom_json.py](scripts/create_custom_json.py) to generate the custom json.

[create_custom_json.py](scripts/create_custom_json.py) requires a "mapping" file as input with columns describing phenotype name, description, category, and number of cases/controls per study.

Example of such mapping file:

```sh
(base) jmehton@lm0-945-22724 r7 % head FinnGen_pan-UKBB_EstBB_mapping.tsv | column -t -s $'\t'
name                                                  category                                                fg_phenotype                       ukbb_phenotype  estbb_phenotype  fg_n_cases  ukbb_n_cases  estbb_n_cases  fg_n_controls  ukbb_n_controls  estbb_n_controls

```

To create the custom json from a mapping file with these columns and studies (fg, ukbb, est):

```sh
python3 create_custom_json.py --study_prefixes fg,ukbb,estbb --phenotype_col fg_phenotype FinnGen_pan-UKBB_EstBB_mapping.tsv
```

Also make sure the following are correct in the config (most likely you should not need to change these):

* `pheweb_import.pre_annot_sumfile` points to as broad as possible variant list (preferrably generated from the most recent FinnGen variant annotation file). The file needs to have columns `chrom`, `pos`, `ref` and `alt`.
* The key values in the dict defined in `pheweb_import.header_dict` are valid column names found from the sumstat files to be imported.

## Updating phenotype meta data in phenolist-json (R7 from Juha)

create UTF-8 TSV file from Aki's Excel, I've found this to be the best way to avoid double quotes around pheno names and correctly encode weird characters.
open Endpoints_Controls_FINNGEN_ENDPOINTS_DF7_Final_2021-03-05.xlsx in Excel and save as UTF-8 CSV
-install csvkit (terrible deps)

`csvformat -T Endpoints_Controls_FINNGEN_ENDPOINTS_DF7_Final_2021-03-05.csv > Endpoints_Controls_FINNGEN_ENDPOINTS_DF7_Final_2021-03-05.tsv`

in refinery get numbers of cases and controls from cov/pheno file:
E.g in R:
```
cov_pheno <- fread("gunzip -c /mnt/nfs/r7/R7_COV_PHENO_V2.FID.txt.gz")
first_pheno_index <- match("DEATH", names(cov_pheno))[1]
cs <- colSums(cov_pheno[,first_pheno_index:length(cov_pheno)], na.rm=T)
mcs <- colSums(1-cov_pheno[,first_pheno_index:length(cov_pheno)], na.rm=T)
fwrite(data.table(cbind(pheno=names(cs), cases=cs, ctrls=mcs, n_eff=2/(1/cs+1/mcs))), "n_eff.txt", quote=F, sep="\t")
```

in /mnt/nfs/pheweb/r7/phenolist
-copy Aki's files and the above created TSV and the above created n_eff.txt there
`gsutil cp gs://fg-cromwell_fresh/pheweb_import/e4792246-6efb-4b2e-a155-7f0dbbc00380/call-matrix/pheweb/pheno-list.json /mnt/nfs/pheweb/r7/pheno-list.json.orig`

`python3 phenolist.py /mnt/nfs/pheweb/r7/pheno-list.json.orig /mnt/nfs/pheweb/r6/pheno-list.json TAGLIST_DF7.txt Pheweb_FINNGEN

# Deploying PheWeb in Google Cloud using Kubernetes

### 1. Install Docker, Google Cloud SDK, and kubectl

[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)  
[Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/downloads)  
[kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)

Note that there can be at most one minor version difference between kubectl client and server versions: If the server is running v1.8, the client cannot be v1.10. Versions can be checked with `kubectl version`. If they differ too much, download a different version of the client or update the server.

### 2. Build a Docker image and push to Google Container Registry

In repository root:

`docker build -t gcr.io/phewas-development/pheweb:[TAG] -f deploy/Dockerfile .`  
`gcloud docker -- push gcr.io/phewas-development/pheweb:[TAG]`

### 3. Setup the kubernetes cluster

Get credentials for a running cluster:  
`gcloud container clusters get-credentials [CLUSTER-NAME] --zone=europe-west1-b`

Or create a new cluster:  
`gcloud container clusters create [CLUSTER-NAME] --num-nodes=1 --machine-type=n1-standard-1 --zone=europe-west1-b`

Make sure you're in the right kubernetes context:

`kubectl config get-contexts`

If necessary:

`kubectl config use-context [CONTEXT-NAME]`

### 4. Apply kubernetes settings

This example is for R6 data. If using a running cluster:

In e.g. `deploy/pheweb-deployment-r6.yaml` (or other pheweb-deployment-* file), change the Docker image to the one you just created (or make other desired changes, note that `replicas` should usually be the same as the cluster size). Make sure that in `deploy/pheweb-pv-nfs.yaml`(or other pheweb-pv-* file) the NFS / GCE disk is the one you want with the wanted data - and that there is a correct config.py in the data directory of the disk. The data directory needs to be specified (`PHEWEB_DIR`) in `deploy/pheweb-deployment-r6.yaml`.

Then, apply the changes you made (example with dev config):

`kubectl apply -f deploy/pheweb-pv-nfs.yaml` (if changed) and/or  
`kubectl apply -f deploy/pheweb-deployment-r6.yaml`

Or if using a new cluster:

Modify `deploy/pheweb-ingress-r6.yaml`, `deploy/pheweb-deployment-r6.yaml` and `deploy/pheweb-pv-nfs.yaml` -- or other files -- as needed. Then

`kubectl create -f deploy/pheweb-ingress-r6.yaml` and  
`kubectl create -f deploy/pheweb-pv-nfs.yaml` and  
`kubectl create -f deploy/pheweb-deployment-r6.yaml`

### 5. Update running StateFulSet

Example of updating the image used in StatefulSet
`kubectl patch statefulset pheweb-front --type='json' -p='[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/template/spec/containers/0/image", "value":"gcr.io/phewas-development/pheweb:r2-2"}]'`

Kubernetes will try to rolling update so that while some pods are updating, the others are serving using the old image.
In case the new image or settings are not functional Kubernetes will keep on retrying. In this case you need to update settings again first and then delete those pods that keep trying to run with the old settings.

`kubectl delete pod pheweb-front-3`

### 6. Total reset

In case of an incomprehensible situation and it would be great to bring the service back asap, here's how to do a full restart of the cluster (example with R2 and 4 nodes):

```
gcloud container clusters delete [CLUSTER_NAME]
gcloud container clusters create [CLUSTER_NAME] --num-nodes=4 --machine-type=n1-standard-1 --zone=europe-west1-b
kubectl create secret tls finngen-tls --key /path/to/star_finngen_fi.key --cert /path/to/star_finngen_fi.crt
kubectl create -f deploy/pheweb-ingress-r6.yaml
kubectl create -f deploy/pheweb-pv-nfs.yaml
kubectl create -f deploy/pheweb-deployment-r6.yaml
```

### 7. Useful commands

`kubectl get ingress`  
`kubectl describe ingress`  
`kubectl get svc`  
`kubectl describe svc`  
`kubectl get pods`  
`kubectl logs [POD-NAME]`  
`kubectl get events --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp`

# How to Build a PheWeb for your Data

If any of these steps is incorrect, please email me at <pjvh@umich.edu> and I'll see what I can do to improve things.

### 1. Install PheWeb

```bash
pip3 install pheweb
```

- If that doesn't work, follow [the detailed install instructions](etc/detailed-install-instructions.md#detailed-install-instructions).

### 2. Create a directory for your new dataset

1. `mkdir ~/my-new-pheweb && cd ~/my-new-pheweb`

   - This directory will store all data for the pheweb your are building. All `pheweb ...` commands should be run in this directory.
   - You can put it wherever you want and name it whatever you want.

2. If you want to configure any options, make a file `config.py` in your data directory. Some options you can set are:

   - Minor Allele Frequency cutoffs:
     - `assoc_min_maf`: an association (between a phenotype and variant) will only be included if its MAF is greater than this value.  (default: `0`, but it saves disk space during loading, so I usually use at least `variant_inclusion_maf / 2`)
     - `variant_inclusion_maf`: a variant will only be included if it has some associations with MAF greater than this value.  That is, if some or all associations for a variant are above `assoc_min_maf`, but none are above `variant_inclusion_maf`, that entire variant (including all of its associations with phenotypes) will be dropped.  If any association's MAF is above `variant_inclusion_maf`, all associations for that variant that are above `assoc_min_maf` will be included. (default: `0`, but I recommend at least `0.005`)

   - `cache`: a directory where files common to all datasets can be stored. If you don't want one, set `cache = False`. (default: `cache = "~/.pheweb/cache/"`)

### 3. Prepare your association files

You should have one file for each phenotype. It can be gzipped if you want. It should be **tab-delimited** and have a **header row**. Variants must be sorted by chromosome and position, with chromosomes in the order [1-22,X,Y,MT].

- If you are using EPACTS, your files should work just fine. If they don't, email me. EPACTS files won't have `REF` or `ALT`, but PheWeb will parse their `MARKER_ID` column to get those.

The file must have columns for:

| column description | name | other allowed column names | allowed values |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| chromosome | `chrom` | `#chrom` | integer 1-22, `X`, `Y`, `M`, `MT` |
| position | `pos` | `beg`, `begin` | integer | a |
| reference allele | `ref` | | anything |
| alternate allele | `alt` | | anything |
| p-value | `pval` | `pvalue` | number in [0,1] |

_Note: column names are case-insensitive._

_Note: any field may be `.` or `NA`.  For required fields, these values will cause the variant to be dropped._

_Note: if your column name is not one of these, you may set `field_aliases = {"column_name": "field_name"}` in `config.py`.  For example, `field_aliases = {'P_BOLT_LMM_INF': 'pval'}`._

_Note: scientific notation is okay._

You may also have columns for:

| column description | name | allowed column names | allowed values |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| minor allele frequency | `maf` | | number in (0,0.5] |
| allele frequency | `af` | | number in (0,1) |
| allele count | `ac` | | integer |
| effect size | `beta` | | number |
| standard error of effect size | `sebeta` | | number |
| odds ratio | `or` | | number |
| R2 | `r2` | | number |
| number of samples | `num_samples` | `ns`, `n` | integer, must be the same for every variant in its phenotype |
| number of controls | `num_controls` | `ns.ctrl`, `n_controls` | integer, must be the same for every variant in its phenotype |
| number of cases | `num_cases` | `ns.case`, `n_cases` | integer, must be the same for every variant in its phenotype |


### 4. Make a list of your phenotypes

Inside of your data directory, you need a file named `pheno-list.json` that looks like this:

```json
[
 {
  "assoc_files": ["/home/watman/ear-length.epacts.gz"],
  "phenocode": "ear-length"
 },
 {
  "assoc_files": ["/home/watman/eats-kimchi.X.epacts.gz","/home/watman/eats-kimchi.autosomal.epacts.gz"],
  "phenocode": "eats-kimchi"
 }
]
```

`phenocode` must only contain letters, numbers, or any of `_-~`.

That example file only includes the columns `assoc_files` (a list of paths to association files) and `phenocode` (a string representing your phenotype that is valid in a URL). If you want, you can also include:

- `phenostring`: a string that is more descriptive than `phenocode` and will be shown in several places
- `category`: a string that will group together phenotypes in the PheWAS plot and also be shown in several places
- `num_cases`, `num_controls`, and/or `num_samples`: numbers of strings which will be shown in several places
- anything else you want, but you'll have to modify templates to show it.

There are four ways to make a `pheno-list.json`:

1. If you have a csv (or tsv, optionally gzipped) with a header that has EXACTLY the right column names, just import it by running `pheweb phenolist import-phenolist "/path/to/my/pheno-list.csv"`.

   If you have multiple association files for each phenotype, you may put them all into a single column with `|` between them. For example, your file `pheno-list.csv` might look like this:

   ```
   phenocode,assoc_files
   eats-kimchi,/home/watman/eats-kimchi.autosomal.epacts.gz|/home/watman/eats-kimchi.X.epacts.gz
   ear-length,/home/watman/ear-length.all.epacts.gz
   ```

2. If you have one association file per phenotype, you can use a shell-glob and a regex to get assoc-files and phenocodes for them. Suppose that your assocation files are at paths like:

   - `/home/watman/eats-kimchi.epacts.gz`
   - `/home/watman/ear-length.epacts.gz`

   Then you could run `pheweb phenolist glob-files "/home/watman/*.epacts.gz"` to get `assoc-files`.

   To get `phenocodes`, you can use a regex that captures the phenocode from the file path. In most cases (including this one), just use:

   ```
   pheweb phenolist extract-phenocode-from-filepath --simple
   ```

3. If you have multiple association files for some phenotypes, you can follow the directions in 2 and then run `pheweb phenolist unique-phenocode`.

   For example, if your association files are at:

   - `/home/watman/autosomal/eats-kimchi.epacts.gz`
   - `/home/watman/X/eats-kimchi.epacts.gz`
   - `/home/watman/all/ear-length.epacts.gz`

   then you can run:

   ```
   pheweb phenolist glob-files "/home/watman/*/*.epacts.gz"
   pheweb phenolist extract-phenocode-from-filepath --simple
   pheweb phenolist unique-phenocode
   ```

4. If you want to do more advanced things, like merging in more information from another file, email <pjvh@umich.edu> and I'll write documentation for `pheweb phenolist`.

   No matter what you do, please run `pheweb phenolist verify` when you are done to check that it worked correctly. At any point, you may run `pheweb phenolist view` or `pheweb phenolist print-as-csv` to view the current file.

### 5. Load your association files

1. Run `pheweb process`.

   - This step can take hours or days for large datasets.  If you want to use the SLURM cluster scheduler, run `pheweb slurm-parse` for parsing and then `pheweb process --no-parse` for everything else.

2. If something breaks, read the error message.

   - If you can understand the error message, modify your association or config files to avoid it, or drop the problematic phenotypes from `pheno-list.json`.  Then re-run `pheweb process`.
   - If the problem is something that PheWeb should support by default, feel free to email it to me at <pjvh@umich.edu>.
   - If you can't understand the error message, please email your error message to <pjvh@umich.edu> and hopefully I can get back to you quickly.

### 6. Serve the website

Run `pheweb serve --open`.

That command should either open a browser to your new PheWeb, or it should give you a URL that you can open in your browser to access your new PheWeb.
If it doesn't, follow the directions for [hosting a PheWeb and accessing it from your browser](etc/detailed-webserver-instructions.md#hosting-a-pheweb-and-accessing-it-from-your-browser).
